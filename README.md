KUMBH RAKSHAK (कुंभ रक्षक)
“Guarding the Sacred Journey — 1.5 Crore Pilgrims, Zero Left Behind”
Team Name: Tech Teerth
Institute: SGSITS, Indore
Registration ID: TH12137

📖 Prototype Summary
The Maha Kumbh 2025 at Prayagraj expects 66+ crore pilgrims in 45 days, with up to 5 crore in one day. Current systems for crowd management, lost-and-found, and medical response are manual, fragmented, and too slow — often resulting in stampedes, delays, and loss of lives.
Kumbh Rakshak is an AI-powered hybrid safety ecosystem that ensures every pilgrim’s safety through predictive crowd intelligence, Aadhaar-based family registration, and inclusive lost-and-found. The system is designed to prevent emergencies rather than react after harm is done, bridging the digital divide by serving both smartphone and non-smartphone users.
 
⚡ Key Features
•	Aadhaar-Based Registration → Secure onboarding via app, kiosks, QR tokens, and family linking
•	Real-Time Tracking → GPS, WiFi/Bluetooth beacons, CCTV AI, and manual QR check-ins
•	AI Crowd Intelligence → Heatmaps every 30s, 8–10 min early stampede detection, drone monitoring
•	Emergency Automation → AI-detected incidents, 3-min ambulance dispatch, multi-channel alerts (SMS, loudspeakers, app)
•	Lost & Found System → Facial recognition (99.9% accuracy), multilingual helpline, 15-min reunion vs current 3–7 days
🎯 Problem Being Addressed
•	Uncontrolled crowd density → leading to stampedes & fatalities
•	Slow lost-and-found processes → families reunited after several days
•	Delayed medical response → 15–20 min response times cause preventable deaths
•	Exclusion of non-smartphone users → ~40% pilgrims left out of digital solutions
